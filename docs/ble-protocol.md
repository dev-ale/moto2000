# ScramScreen BLE Protocol

**Version:** 1
**Status:** Stable — defined in Slice 1 (#2). Breaking changes require bumping the
`version` byte and updating every fixture under `protocol/fixtures/`.

This document is the single source of truth for the BLE wire format between the iOS
companion app and the ESP32 firmware. The Swift encoder in
`app/ios/Packages/BLEProtocol/` and the C codec in
`hardware/firmware/components/ble_protocol/` both derive their constants from this
spec and are validated against shared golden fixtures in `protocol/fixtures/`.

## Service

| Name | UUID |
|---|---|
| ScramScreen Service | `b6ca8101-b172-4d33-8518-8b1700235ed2` |

## Characteristics

| Name | UUID | Properties | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `screen_data` | `3ad9d5d0-1d70-4edf-b2cc-bf1d84dc545b` | write, write-without-response | Phone → ESP32 | Screen payload — header + screen-specific body |
| `control`     | `160c1f54-82ec-45e2-8339-1680f16c1a94` | write                          | Phone → ESP32 | Control commands (defined in Slice 5) |
| `status`      | `b7066d36-d896-4e74-9648-500df789d969` | notify, read                   | ESP32 → Phone | Device status (defined in Slice 2) |

## Wire format

All multi-byte integers are **little-endian**. Strings are UTF-8, zero-padded to a
fixed length, and must include a terminating `0x00` byte — if the string is shorter
than the field, bytes after the terminator are ignored on decode and must be zero on
encode.

Every write to `screen_data` begins with the common 8-byte header:

```
 0               1               2               3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|    version    |   screen_id   |     flags     |   reserved    |
+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
|         data_length           |     body (variable length)    |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
```

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | `uint8` | Protocol version. Current: `0x01`. Decoders must reject unknown versions. |
| `screen_id` | `uint8` | See Screen IDs table. |
| `flags` | `uint8` | See Flags bitfield. |
| `reserved` | `uint8` | Must be `0x00` on encode. Decoders must reject non-zero. |
| `data_length` | `uint16` | Length of the body in bytes. Must equal the expected body length for the given `screen_id`. |
| `body` | bytes | Screen-specific payload. |

Total header size: **8 bytes**. Minimum packet size: 8 bytes (empty body, e.g. a
clock screen that sends only the body below — still non-empty).

### Framing rules

- Encoders must emit `version = 0x01`, `reserved = 0x00`, and `data_length` equal
  to `body.count`.
- Decoders must fail with a clear error if any of the following hold:
  - Buffer is shorter than 8 bytes (`truncatedHeader`).
  - `version != 0x01` (`unsupportedVersion`).
  - `reserved != 0x00` (`invalidReserved`).
  - `data_length > remainingBytes` (`truncatedBody`).
  - `screen_id` is not in the Screen IDs table (`unknownScreenId`).
  - Body length does not match the expected length for the screen
    (`bodyLengthMismatch`).
  - Flags bits 3..7 are set (`reservedFlagsSet`).

## Screen IDs

| ID | Constant | Name | Slice | Body type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x01` | `navigation`    | Navigation        | 6   | `nav_data_t` |
| `0x02` | `speedHeading`  | Speed + Heading   | 3   | TBD |
| `0x03` | `compass`       | Compass           | 4   | `compass_data_t` |
| `0x04` | `weather`       | Weather           | 7   | `weather_data_t` |
| `0x05` | `tripStats`     | Trip Stats        | 9   | `trip_stats_data_t` |
| `0x06` | `music`         | Music             | 8   | TBD |
| `0x07` | `leanAngle`     | Lean Angle        | 10  | `lean_angle_data_t` |
| `0x08` | `blitzer`       | Blitzer / Radar   | 14  | TBD |
| `0x09` | `incomingCall`  | Incoming Call     | 13  | TBD |
| `0x0A` | `fuelEstimate`  | Fuel Estimate     | 12  | `fuel_data_t` |
| `0x0B` | `altitude`      | Altitude Profile  | 15  | TBD |
| `0x0C` | `appointment`   | Next Appointment  | 11  | `appointment_data_t` |
| `0x0D` | `clock`         | Idle / Clock      | 2   | `clock_data_t` |

All other values are reserved and must be rejected by decoders.

## Flags bitfield

Bit 0 is the least significant.

| Bit | Constant | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `ALERT` | This payload is an alert overlay with priority — ESP32 interrupts the current screen and returns after `STALE` or a clear command. |
| 1 | `NIGHT_MODE` | Render in night palette (dim background, red-shift UI). |
| 2 | `STALE` | Data is stale — renderer shows a visual staleness indicator. |
| 3–7 | reserved | Must be `0`. |

## Screen body definitions

### `clock_data_t` (screen `0x0D`)

Body size: **12 bytes**

| Offset | Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `unix_time` | `uint64` | Seconds since Unix epoch, UTC. |
| 8 | `tz_offset_minutes` | `int16` | Local timezone offset from UTC, in minutes. Range `-720..=840`. |
| 10 | `flags` | `uint8` | Bit 0: 24-hour format. Other bits reserved. |
| 11 | `reserved` | `uint8` | Must be `0x00`. |

### `compass_data_t` (screen `0x03`)

Body size: **8 bytes**

| Offset | Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `magnetic_heading_deg_x10` | `uint16` | Magnetic heading × 10. Range `0..=3599`. |
| 2 | `true_heading_deg_x10` | `uint16` | True heading × 10. Range `0..=3599`, or `0xFFFF` if the heading fix is unavailable (e.g. no GPS lock yet). |
| 4 | `heading_accuracy_deg_x10` | `uint16` | Reported heading accuracy × 10 in degrees. Range `0..=3599`. |
| 6 | `compass_flags` | `uint8` | Bit 0: `USE_TRUE_HEADING`. If set, the screen renders the true heading; otherwise magnetic. Bits 1..7 reserved, must be `0`. |
| 7 | `reserved` | `uint8` | Must be `0x00`. |

If `USE_TRUE_HEADING` is set but `true_heading_deg_x10 == 0xFFFF`, the renderer falls back to the magnetic reading and displays a `MAG` label instead of `TRU`.

### `lean_angle_data_t` (screen `0x07`)

Body size: **8 bytes**

| Offset | Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `current_lean_deg_x10` | `int16` | Current lean × 10. Negative = left lean, positive = right lean. Range `-900..=900` (±90.0°). |
| 2 | `max_left_lean_deg_x10` | `uint16` | Max left lean magnitude × 10 (unsigned). Range `0..=900`. |
| 4 | `max_right_lean_deg_x10` | `uint16` | Max right lean magnitude × 10 (unsigned). Range `0..=900`. |
| 6 | `confidence_percent` | `uint8` | Renderer confidence in the calculation, `0..=100`. Drops when non-gravitational acceleration spikes (hard braking, bumps). |
| 7 | `reserved` | `uint8` | Must be `0x00`. |

The sign convention is locked in here so the iOS calculator, the C
codec, and the host-sim renderer all agree: a bike leaning *right*
produces a *positive* `current_lean_deg_x10`. The same convention is
documented in `LeanAngleCalculator.swift`.

### `nav_data_t` (screen `0x01`)

Body size: **56 bytes**

| Offset | Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `lat_e7` | `int32` | Latitude × 10⁷. Range `-900000000..=900000000`. |
| 4 | `lng_e7` | `int32` | Longitude × 10⁷. Range `-1800000000..=1800000000`. |
| 8 | `speed_kmh_x10` | `uint16` | Speed × 10. Max 3000 (300.0 km/h). |
| 10 | `heading_deg_x10` | `uint16` | Heading × 10. Range `0..=3599`. |

| 50 | `remaining_km_x10` | `uint16` | Remaining distance × 10. `0xFFFF` = unknown. |
| 52 | `reserved2` | `uint32` | Must be `0x00000000`. |

### `trip_stats_data_t` (screen `0x05`)

Body size: **16 bytes**

| Offset | Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `ride_time_seconds` | `uint32` | Total accumulated ride time, in seconds. Sum of positive `Δt` between consecutive samples (so scenario gaps do not inflate it). |
| 4 | `distance_meters` | `uint32` | Total accumulated distance, in metres (haversine between consecutive samples). |
| 8 | `average_speed_kmh_x10` | `uint16` | Average ground speed × 10. Range `0..=3000` (300.0 km/h). Computed as `distance_m / ride_time_s × 3.6 × 10` and clamped. |

| 12 | `ascent_meters` | `uint16` | Total positive elevation change, in metres. Altitude jitter under 1 m is ignored. |
| 14 | `descent_meters` | `uint16` | Total negative elevation change (magnitude), in metres. |

### `music_data_t` (screen `0x06`)

Body size: **86 bytes**

| Offset | Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `music_flags` | `uint8` | Bit 0: `PLAYING`. Bits 1..7 reserved, must be `0`. |
| 1 | `reserved` | `uint8` | Must be `0x00`. |
| 2 | `position_seconds` | `uint16` | Current playback position. `0xFFFF` = unknown (e.g. live radio stream). |
| 4 | `duration_seconds` | `uint16` | Track duration. `0xFFFF` = unknown. |
| 6 | `title` | `char[32]` | UTF-8, zero-padded, null-terminated. ≤ 31 bytes. |
| 38 | `artist` | `char[24]` | UTF-8, zero-padded, null-terminated. ≤ 23 bytes. |
| 62 | `album` | `char[24]` | UTF-8, zero-padded, null-terminated. ≤ 23 bytes. |

See [platform-limits.md](platform-limits.md) for the iOS `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter`
restriction — Slice 8 ships a testable protocol seam but defers the system
framework wiring to a follow-up.

### `appointment_data_t` (screen `0x0C`)

Body size: **60 bytes**

| Offset | Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `starts_in_minutes` | `int16` | Minutes until event start. Negative = already started. Range `-1440..=10080` (plus/minus 7 days). |
| 2 | `title` | `char[32]` | UTF-8, zero-padded, null-terminated. Must contain a terminator (len < 32). |
| 34 | `location` | `char[24]` | UTF-8, zero-padded, null-terminated. Must contain a terminator (len < 24). |
| 58 | `reserved` | `uint16` | Must be `0x0000`. |

### `fuel_data_t` (screen `0x0A`)

Body size: **8 bytes**

| Offset | Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `tank_percent` | `uint8` | Estimated fuel remaining as percentage. Range `0..=100`. |
| 1 | `reserved` | `uint8` | Must be `0x00`. |
| 2 | `estimated_range_km` | `uint16` | Estimated remaining range in km. `0xFFFF` = unknown. |
| 4 | `consumption_ml_per_km` | `uint16` | Average fuel consumption in mL/km. `0xFFFF` = unknown. |
| 6 | `fuel_remaining_ml` | `uint16` | Estimated fuel remaining in mL. `0xFFFF` = unknown. |

The Scram 411 has no fuel sensor or OBD port. All values are computed from
manual fill logging: the rider records fill-ups and the app tracks distance
via GPS. If no full fills have been logged, consumption is unknown and all
uint16 fields are set to `0xFFFF`.

The `tank_percent` is derived from `fuel_remaining_ml / tank_capacity_ml * 100`
where `tank_capacity_ml` is a user-configurable constant (default 13 000 mL
for the Scram 411's 13 L tank).

### EventKit integration note (Slice 11)

The Slice 11 iOS code ships a `CalendarServiceClient` abstraction with a
`StaticCalendarServiceClient` for tests and an `EventKitCalendarClient` stub
that throws `notImplemented`. Wiring the real EventKit API requires an
`NSCalendarsFullAccessUsageDescription` key in Info.plist (iOS 17+) and a
runtime `EKEventStore.requestFullAccessToEvents()` call, both of which are
deferred to a follow-up PR that will swap the stub without touching the wire
format.

### Maneuver types

### `weather_data_t` (screen `0x04`)

Body size: **28 bytes**

| Offset | Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `condition` | `uint8` | See Weather conditions below. |
| 1 | `reserved` | `uint8` | Must be `0x00`. |
| 2 | `temperature_celsius_x10` | `int16` | Current temperature × 10. Range `-500..=600` (-50°C..60°C). |
| 4 | `high_celsius_x10` | `int16` | Daily high × 10. Same range. |
| 6 | `low_celsius_x10` | `int16` | Daily low × 10. Same range. |
| 8 | `location_name` | `char[20]` | UTF-8, zero-padded, null-terminated. Must contain a terminator (len < 20). |

### Weather conditions

|---|---|
| `0x00` | `clear` |
| `0x01` | `cloudy` |
| `0x02` | `rain` |
| `0x03` | `snow` |
| `0x04` | `fog` |
| `0x05` | `thunderstorm` |

Unknown values are rejected with `valueOutOfRange` (field `weather.condition`).

### WeatherKit integration note (Slice 7)

The Slice 7 iOS code ships a `WeatherServiceClient` abstraction with a
`StaticWeatherServiceClient` for tests and a `WeatherKitClient` stub that
throws `notImplemented`. Wiring the real WeatherKit REST API requires an
Apple Developer account with the WeatherKit capability and a signed `.p8`
key — both infrastructure concerns outside the scope of the dashboard
protocol work. A follow-up PR will replace the stub without touching the
wire format.

Other screen body definitions are added by their respective slices and follow the
same pattern: fixed offsets, fixed size, explicit reserved bytes.

## Control commands

Defined in Slice 5 (#6). The `control` characteristic accepts fixed-size
4-byte writes from the iOS app. Every command shares the same envelope:

```
 0       1       2       3
+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|version|  cmd  |   value...    |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+
```

| Field | Bytes | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | 1 | `0x01`, same as the screen-data version. |
| `command` | 1 | See command table below. |
| `value`   | 2 | Command-specific. Bytes not used by a given command must be `0x00` on encode and decoders must reject non-zero. |

The total encoded size is **always 4 bytes**. Picking a fixed size keeps the
codec boring and the wire-format diff between Swift and C trivially
verifiable against the golden fixtures under `protocol/fixtures/control/`.

### Command table

| ID | Name | Value bytes | Body | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `0x01` | `setActiveScreen`   | 1 | byte 0: `screen_id` (see [Screen IDs](#screen-ids)); byte 1: `0x00` | Switch the active persistent screen. |
| `0x02` | `setBrightness`     | 1 | byte 0: brightness `0..100`; byte 1: `0x00` | Set panel brightness as a percentage. |
| `0x03` | `sleep`             | 0 | both bytes `0x00` | Dim and enter sleep state. |
| `0x04` | `wake`              | 0 | both bytes `0x00` | Wake from sleep, return to the previously selected screen. |
| `0x05` | `clearAlertOverlay` | 0 | both bytes `0x00` | Clear any active alert overlay and return to the previously selected screen. |

### Decoder rules

Decoders must fail with a clear error if any of the following hold:

- Buffer is shorter than 4 bytes (`truncatedHeader`).
- `version != 0x01` (`unsupportedVersion`).
- `command` is not in the table above (`unknownCommand`).
- The unused trailing value byte for a command is non-zero (`invalidReserved`).
- `setActiveScreen.screen_id` is not in the [Screen IDs](#screen-ids) table
  (`unknownScreenId`).
- `setBrightness` value > 100 (`invalidCommandValue`).

## Status notifications

Defined in Slice 2 (#3). Placeholder.

### Staleness flag and the last-known-payload cache

The `STALE` flag (bit 2 in the screen header — see
[Flags bitfield](#flags-bitfield)) is raised by the ESP32 renderer
when the last-known payload for the current screen is older than a configured
threshold. It is **not** set by the iOS side on the wire; the ESP32 owns it
because the ESP32 is the side that keeps drawing during BLE outages.

Slice 17 adds two matching caches that cooperate with this flag:

- **iOS** — `BLECentralClient.LastKnownPayloadCache` stores the last body
  successfully written per `ScreenID`. During a reconnect loop the UI can ask
  the cache for a snapshot and render a "last known" state instead of a blank
  widget. The cache is clock-agnostic; callers pass a timestamp on every
  mutation so tests drive it with a `VirtualClock`.
- **ESP32** — the `ble_reconnect` component exposes an equivalent
  `ble_payload_cache_t` (14 slots, one per screen id, 64-byte bodies) that the
  firmware updates on every successful write and queries from the render loop.
  When `ble_payload_cache_is_stale()` returns `true` for the active screen,
  the renderer sets the `STALE` flag on whatever frame it draws from the
  cached body.

The staleness threshold is a property of the renderer, not the wire format —
both sides default to 2 seconds and can be tuned per screen without a
protocol bump. See [background-ble.md](./background-ble.md) for the full
reconnect lifecycle.

## Golden fixtures

Shared binary fixtures for round-trip tests live in `protocol/fixtures/`. Each
fixture is a raw byte blob (`.bin`) accompanied by a `.json` description of its
decoded contents. The Swift `BLEProtocolTests` target and the C `test_ble_protocol`
Unity binary both load the same files and assert:

1. Decoding the blob produces exactly the values in the `.json`.
2. Re-encoding those values produces exactly the original bytes.

Any change to the wire format must ship with fixture updates in the same commit.
